This plugin allows customers with a Portuguese bank account to pay WooCommerce orders using using Multibanco (Pag. Serviços), MB WAY, Credit card and Payshop through IfthenPay’s payment gateway.

== Description ==

“Pagamento de Serviços” (payment of services) on Multibanco (Portuguese ATM network), or Home Banking services, is the most popular way to pay for services and (online) purchases in Portugal. Portuguese consumers trust the “Multibanco” system more than any other.
This plugin will allow you to generate a payment Reference the customer can then use to pay for his WooCommerce order, through an ATM or Home Banking service.

The MB WAY (using the customer mobile phone number), Credit or debit card and CTT Payshop payment methods are also available.

This is the official [IfthenPay](https://ifthenpay.com) plugin, and a contract with this company is required. Technical support is provided by [Webdados](https://www.webdados.pt).

**This plugin will soon require WordPress 5.0, WooCommerce 3.4 and PHP 7.0 or above.**
If you cannot update any of these components, you should check the changelog of this plugin to find out which is the last version you can use in your scenario.

= Are you already issuing automatic invoices on your WooCommerce store? =

If not, get to know our new plugin: [Invoicing with InvoiceXpress for WooCommerce](https://wordpress.org/plugins/woo-billing-with-invoicexpress/)

= Features: =

* Generates a Multibanco Reference for simple payment on the Portuguese ATM network or Home Banking service;

* Automatically changes the order status to “Processing” (or “Completed” if the order only contains virtual downloadable products) and notifies both the customer and the store owner, if the automatic “Callback” upon payment is activated; 
* Automatic “Callback” can be activated upon request to IfthenPay, via the plugin settings screen for each payment method;
* Shop owner can set minimum and maximum order totals for each payment gateway to be available;
* Ability to reduce stock when the order is created or paid;

	* Lock the cart so you can only have products from the same account on each order;

== Installation ==

* Use the included automatic install feature on your WordPress admin panel and search for “Multibanco, MB WAY, Credit card and Payshop (IfthenPay) for WooCommerce”.
* Multibanco: Go to WooCoomerce > Settings > Checkout > Pagamento de Serviços no Multibanco and fill in the data provided by IfthenPay (Entity and Subentity) in order to use this payment method. A contract with IfthenPay is mandatory to receive this data.
* MB WAY: Go to WooCoomerce > Settings > Checkout > Pagamento MB WAY no telemóvel and fill in the data provided by IfthenPay (MB WAY Key) in order to use this payment method. A contract with IfthenPay is mandatory to receive this data.
* Credit or debit card: Go to WooCoomerce > Settings > Checkout > Credit or debit card and fill in the data provided by IfthenPay (Credit card Key) in order to use this payment method. A contract with IfthenPay is mandatory to receive this data.
* Payshop: Go to WooCoomerce > Settings > Checkout > Pagamento na rede de agentes Payshop and fill in the data provided by IfthenPay (Payshop Key) in order to use this payment method. A contract with IfthenPay is mandatory to receive this data.
* Make sure you ask IfthenPay to activate the “Callback” on their side with the URL and Anti-phishing key provided in the settings screen. There is a feature in each payment method screen that allows you to make this request via a webservice, except on Credit card where this is not needed.
* Start receiving payments :-)

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I start receiving payments right away? Show me the money! =

Nop! You have to sign a contract with IfthenPay in order to activate this service. Go to [https://ifthenpay.com](https://ifthenpay.com) for more information.

= I’m a individual and not a registered business. Can I use this plugin? =

No. IfthenPay only provides this service to registered businesses and equivalent (like tax registered freelancers, for example). You should [contact them](https://ifthenpay.com/#contactos) if you need additional details on this matter.

= The generated Multibanco reference does not contain the order number. How do I know which order was paid? =

IfthenPay will send you an email each time a reference is paid, but the reference does not contain the order number. By design, our plugin does not include the order number in the reference due to the way WooCommerce/WordPress set orders/posts IDs.

Anyway, you do not need the order number in the reference, because our plugin uses a callback mechanism. IfthenPay automatically notifies WooCommerce when a specific Multibanco reference is used for payment. The order is linked to the reference in the database and, also automatically, will be set as paid.

If you still need to know to which order a reference is linked to, use the search box in the WooCommerce Orders administration screen.

= Can I test the callback call to simulate a payment and foresee what happens when a real payment is made by a customer? =

Yes, you can. Edit your wp-config.php file and set WP_DEBUG to true. Then, place a test order in the frontend using Multibanco, MB WAY or PayShop. Go to the order edit screen and click the “Simulate callback payment” button.

= Can I use this plugin / IfthenPay service on more than one website? =

Yes, but not with the same Multibanco entity and subentity, MB WAY, Credit card or Payshop Keys. Ask IfthenPay for different credentials for each website you need the service to be available. There is no extra costs involved, and you can even route payments to distinct bank accounts.

= Can I change the payment instructions look and feel in the “Thank you” page and/or the new order email, as well as the SMS message format? =

Yes you can! But you should know your way around WordPress filters. There are filters to do this and you can find examples within `hooks-examples.php`.

= Can I change the payment gateway icon in the checkout page? =

There are also filters for this. See `hooks-examples.php`.

= I want to charge an additional fee for Multibanco, MB WAY, Credit card or Payshop payments. How should I do it? =

You shouldn’t! To our knowledge, it’s illegal under [Portuguese law](https://www.bportugal.pt/sites/default/files/anexos/legislacoes/dl3ano2010.PDF) and a [European directive](https://europa.eu/youreurope/business/finance-funding/making-receiving-payments/electronic-cash-payments/index_en.htm) to charge an extra fee based on the payment method chosen by the customer.
If you don’t care about legislation, plugins are available that allow you to set extra fees per payment method. Please, don’t ask us for support on this.

= How much time does the customer have to pay with MB WAY? =

The MB WAY payment requests expire after 5 minutes.

= [WPML] My website is multilingual. Will I be able to use this plugin? =

Yes. This plugin is officially WPML compatible. You will need the WPML and WPML String Translation Plugins (alongside WooCommerce Multilingual, which is mandatory for any WooCommerce + WPML install). 

= [WPML] How can I translate the payment method title and description the customer sees in the checkout page to secondary languages? =

Go to WPML > String Translation > Search and translate all the string in the `woocommerce` and `multibanco_ifthen_for_woocommerce` domains containing `ifthen_for_woocommerce` in their name.

= [SMS] How to include the Multibanco and/or Payshop payment instructions in the SMS sent by “WooCommerce - APG SMS Notifications”? =

Go to WooCommerce > SMS Notifications and add the `%multibanco_ifthen%` and/or `%payshop_ifthen%` variables to “Order on-hold custom message”.

= [SMS] How to include the Multibanco and/or Payshop payment instructions in the SMS sent by “Twilio SMS Notifications”? =

Go to WooCommerce > Settings > SMS and add the `%multibanco_ifthen%` and/or `%payshop_ifthen%` variables to “Customer Notifications“ > “On Hold SMS Message”.

= [SMS] How to include the Multibanco and/or Payshop payment instructions in the SMS sent by “YITH WooCommerce SMS Notification”? =

Go to YITH Plugins > SMS Notifications > SMS Settings and add the `{multibanco_ifthen}` and/or `{payshop_ifthen}` variables to “On hold”.

= [Advanced] Can I use a specific Multibanco Entity/Subentity, MB WAY, Credit card or Payshop Key based on order details? =

Yes, you should use the `multibanco_ifthen_base_ent_subent`, `multibanco_ifthen_base_mbwaykey`, `multibanco_ifthen_base_creditcardkey` or `multibanco_ifthen_base_payshopkey` filters. See `hooks-examples.php`.

= [Advanced] The order is set “On Hold” for Multibanco and Payshop, can I make it “Pending” by default? =

I don’t know why on earth you would want to do this, but… yes, you can. Just return `false` to the `multibanco_ifthen_set_on_hold` and/or `payshop_ifthen_set_on_hold` filter.
Be advised that no “new order” email, with payment instructions, will be sent to the customer unless you use some plugin or custom code to force it.

= [Advanced] I’ve set up WooCommerce to cancel unpaid orders after x minutes, why are my Multibanco and/or Payshop orders not being canceled? =

WooCommerce only automatically cancels “Pending” orders, not “On Hold”, because these orders are set to be paid by offline methods (like Multibanco or Payshop), and payment can occur at any time, even after the order is canceled. Still, if you want to take that risk, just return `true` to the `multibanco_ifthen_cancel_unpaid_orders` and/or `payshop_ifthen_cancel_unpaid_orders` filter.
You can also restore that order’s product stock by returning `true` to the `multibanco_ifthen_cancel_unpaid_orders_restore_stock` and/or `payshop_ifthen_cancel_unpaid_orders_restore_stock` filter, although the WooCommerce team [doesn’t recommend](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/issues/3712#issuecomment-23650563) it.
Be advised the Multibanco or Payshop reference will still be active and can be paid later on.

= [Advanced] Can I prevent the plugin from adding the payment instructions and/or the payment received message to emails? =

You can use the `multibanco_ifthen_email_instructions_pending_send` and/or `mbway_ifthen_email_instructions_pending_send` filter: return false and the payment instructions won’t be included in the “new order” email – we do not recommend you to do it, though.
You can use the `multibanco_ifthen_email_instructions_payment_received_send` and/or `mbway_ifthen_email_instructions_payment_received_send` filter: return false and the payment received message won’t be included in the “Processing” or “Completed” email.

= IfthenPay says my callback URL is returning a 404 error. Should I sit in a corner and cry or is there a solution? =

Don’t cry! There’s a solution!
You probably have weird permalink settings (or permalinks not set at all) in your WordPress installation.
Tell them to change the callback URL from `https://yourwebsite/wc-api/WC_Multibanco_IfThen_Webdados/?chave=[CHAVE_ANTI_PHISHING]&entidade=[ENTIDADE]&referencia=[REFERENCIA]&valor=[VALOR]` to `https://yourwebsite/?wc-api=WC_Multibanco_IfThen_Webdados&chave=[CHAVE_ANTI_PHISHING]&entidade=[ENTIDADE]&referencia=[REFERENCIA]&valor=[VALOR]`.

= I need technical support. Who should I contact, IfthenPay or Webdados? =

Although this is the official IfthenPay WooCommerce plugin, development and support is provided by [Webdados](https://www.webdados.pt).
For free/standard support you should use the support forums here at WordPress.org
For premium, urgent and experimental integrations support or custom developments you should contact [Webdados](https://www.webdados.pt/contactos/). Charges may (and most certainly will) apply.

Any support related to failed payments or credit card authorizations should be directed to [IfthenPay](https://ifthenpay.com/#contactos).

= Is this plugin compliant with the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)? =

This plugin does not collect or send to Webdados (the plugin author) or IfthenPay (the payment processor) any private data of the website where it’s installed, it’s customers or the orders themselves.
In the MB WAY module, the mobile phone number is collected to request the payment authorization and it can be legitimately processed based on article 6 (1) (b) of the GDPR.
IfthenPay’s privacy policy can be found at [https://ifthenpay.com/termosCondicoes](https://ifthenpay.com/termosCondicoes)

= Can I contribute with a translation? =

Sure. Go to [GlotPress](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/multibanco-ifthen-software-gateway-for-woocommerce) and help us out.
