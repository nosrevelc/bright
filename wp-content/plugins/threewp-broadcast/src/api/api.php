/**
	@brief		API methods, to make life easier for developers.
	@details

This is read much easier if you run doxygen...

<h2>Using the API</h2>

Retrieve the API object by asking Broadcast for it.

<code>$api = ThreeWP_Broadcast()->api();</code>

Or call an API method directly.

<code>ThreeWP_Broadcast()->api()->broadcast_children( 123, [ 10, 11, 12 ] );</code>

<h2>Broadcasting</h2>

The methods below refer to the post ID on the current blog.

To broadcast a post to one or more blogs, see broadcast_children(). The posts will be linked as children.

To rebroadcast (update) the post, see update_children(). You can also, optionally, specified an array of new blog IDs which to add the post. Linking is parent <-> child.

Broadcasting is done like so:

<ul>
	<li>A broadcasting_data (bcd) object is created with the specified post_id as the source.</li>
	<li>The bcd will examine the post and prepare itself, setting its internal properties.</li>
	<li>The bcd constructor will create and prepare the meta_box_data object, which allows plugins to do things like force broadcast to blogs or similar.</li>
	<li>Optionally, the prepare_broadcasting_data action is executed in order to parse the meta box, to see which options and blogs are selected. This is only done when input from the user needs to be parsed. This is not run when using the API.</li>
	<li>The threewp_broadcast_broadcast_post action is executed, which will broadcast the post. The queue plugin overrides this hook and stores the bcd for later.</li>
	<li>The bcd object is returned.</li>
</ul>

If you wish to not use the default broadcasting_data values (perhaps you don't want taxonomies broadcasted), then you should create the bcd object yourself, modify it, and then run action.

<h2>Linking</h2>

Get a linking controller for post 943 on blog 34.

<code>$linking = ThreeWP_Broadcast()->api()->linking( 34, 943 );</code>

Link it child post 32 on blog 4.

<code>$linking->link( 4, 32 );</code>

Unlink it. This will unlink the child(ren) also.

<code>$linking->unlink();</code>
