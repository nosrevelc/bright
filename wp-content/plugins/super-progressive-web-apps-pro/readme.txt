SuperPWA PRO helps you convert your WordPress website into a Progressive Web App instantly.

== Description ==

Progressive Web Apps (PWA) is a new technology that combines the best of mobile web and the best of mobile apps to create a superior mobile web experience. They are installed on the phone like a normal app (web app) and can be accessed from the home screen.

Please give us your constructive feedback and support. 

== Installation ==

To install this plugin:

= GDPR Compliance =

SuperPWA does not collect or store user data, nor does it set cookies or store tracking data. Content visited by users from your PWA is stored in the user's own device, in the cache of the browser. This is very similar to how modern browsers caches content offline for faster browsing. 

With the UTM Tracking Add-On, you will be able to differentiate the visits originating from your PWA in your analytics software. You may have to include this in your privacy policy. Please note that SuperPWA does not track the visits, we just help you add the UTM parameters to the URL of the Start Page of your app so that third party analytics tools can differentiate the visits. 

Feel free to get in touch if you have any questions.
