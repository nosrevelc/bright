WidgiLabs WordPress Plugin Template
=========================

Template for Plugin Development


## Why this template?

After writing many WordPress plugins we feel the need to have a codebase in order to make it uniforme as we develop new plugins

## How do I use it?

You can simply copy the files out of this repo and rename everything as you need it.



#### Registering a new post type

+ add the new post type in the Admin Class
+ add a new class for the post type to the lib/PostType dir

#### Registering a new taxonomy

+ add the new taxonomy in the Admin Class
+ add a new class for the taxonomy  to the lib/Taxonomy dir


## What does this template give me?

This template includes the following features:

+ Plugin headers as required by WordPress & WordPress.org
+ Readme.txt file as required by WordPress.org
+ Main plugin class
+ Grunt.js support
+ A library for easily registering a new post type
+ A library for easily registering a new taxonomy
+ Full text of the GPLv2 license
